Getting started with Integration Framework
******************************************

.. contents:: Table of Contents

The IntegrationsBundle is meant to be a drop in replacement for Mautic's PluginBundle's AbstractIntegration class. It provides cleaner interfaces for configuring, authenticating and syncing contacts/companies with third party integrations.

An example HelloWorld plugin is available https://github.com/mautic/plugin-helloworld.

---------

Using the Integration Framework
===============================

Registering the Integration for Authentication
_______________________________________________

If the integration requires authentication with the third party service

1. :ref:`Register the integration<Registering the Integration for Authentication>` as an integration that requires configuration options.
2. Create a custom Symfony form type for the required credentials and return it as part of the :ref:`config interface<ConfigFormAuthInterface>`.
3. Create a custom service that builds and configures the Guzzle client required to authenticate and communicate with the third party service. Use an [existing supported factory or create a new one](#authentication-providers).

Registering the Integration for Configuration
_____________________________________________

If the integration has extra configuration settings for features unique to it

1. :ref:`Register the integration<Registering the Integration for Configuration>` as an integration that requires configuration options.
2. Create a custom Symfony form type for the features and return it as part of the :ref:`config form feature setting interface<ConfigFormFeatureSettingsInterface>`.

The sync engine
________________
If the integration syncs with Mautic's contacts and/or companies

1. Read about :doc:`the sync engine<sync>`.

Registering the Integration as a Builder
________________________________________
If the integration includes a builder integration (email or landing page)
1. :ref:`Register the integration<Registering the Integration as a Builder>` as an integration that provides a custom builder.
2. Configure what featured builders the integration supports (Mautic currently supports "email" and "page" builders).

Basics
======

Each integration provides its unique name as registered with Mautic, icon, and display name. When an integration is registered, the integration helper classes will manage the ``\Mautic\PluginBundle\Entity\Integration`` object through ``\Mautic\IntegrationsBundle\Integration\Interfaces\IntegrationInterface``. It handles decryption and encryption of the integration's API keys so the implementing code never has to.

Registering the Integration
___________________________
All integrations whether it uses the config, auth or sync interfaces must have a class that registers itself with Mautic. The integration will be listed no the ``/s/plugins`` page.

In the plugin's ``Config/config.php``, register the integration using the tag ``mautic.basic_integration``.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    return [
        // ...
        'services' => [
            // ...
            'integrations' => [
                'helloworld.integration' => [
                    'class' => \MauticPlugin\HelloWorldBundle\Integration\HelloWorldIntegration::class,
                    'tags'  => [
                        'mautic.basic_integration',
                    ],
                ],
                // ...
            ],
            // ...
        ],
        // ...
    ];

The ``HelloWorldIntegration`` will need to implement ``\Mautic\IntegrationsBundle\Integration\Interfaces\IntegrationInterface`` and ``\Mautic\IntegrationsBundle\Integration\Interfaces\BasicInterface`` interfaces. Most use cases can simply extend the ``\Mautic\IntegrationsBundle\Integration\BasicIntegration`` abstract class then define the ``getName()``, ``getDisplayName()`` and ``getIcon()`` methods.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    namespace MauticPlugin\HelloWorldBundle\Integration;

    use MauticPlugin\IntegrationsBundle\Integration\BasicIntegration;
    use MauticPlugin\IntegrationsBundle\Integration\Interfaces\BasicInterface;
    use MauticPlugin\IntegrationsBundle\Integration\Interfaces\IntegrationInterface;

    class HelloWorldIntegration extends BasicIntegration
    {
        const NAME = 'HelloWorld';

        public function getName(): string
        {
            return self::NAME;
        }

        public function getDisplayName(): string
        {
            return 'Hello World';
        }

        public function getIcon(): string
        {
            return 'plugins/HelloWorldBundle/Assets/img/helloworld.png';
        }
    }
