How to install Mautic
#####################

Pre-requisites
==============
1 - You must already have Composer available on your computer because this is a development release and you'll need Composer to download the vendor packages. If you don't have Composer, you can download it from http://getcomposer.org.

Installing Mautic is a simple three-step process:
==================================================

1. Download the repository zip in Mautic GitHub then extract the zip to your web root.
2. Run the ``composer install`` command to install the required packages.
3. Open your browser and complete the installation through the web installer.
