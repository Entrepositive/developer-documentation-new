How to install Mautic
#####################

Pre-requisites
==============
1. You must already have Composer available on your computer, as you're working in development mode and you'll need Composer to download the vendor packages. If you don't have Composer, you can download it from :xref:`composer`.

Installing Mautic is a three-step process:
==========================================

1. Download the repository zip from :xref:`Mautic's GitHub Repo` then extract the zip to your web root, or clone the repository with the instructions in :doc:`/development-environment/how_to_install_with_ddev`.
2. Run the ``composer install`` command to install the required packages.
3. Open your browser and complete the installation through the web installer.

If you get stuck, join the lively Mautic Community on :xref:`Mautic Slack` or the :xref:`Developer Forum` for support and answers. Please first post in the forum, then share the link in Slack, so we can help others to learn from your question.
